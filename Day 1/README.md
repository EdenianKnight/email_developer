## ✅ What You Must Do:

1. **Watch the video and practice along.**  
   - Don’t worry if you don’t understand everything (you most likely will understand).  
   - The goal is to **practice first**.  
   - **Do exactly what the video does**—every detail, every element.  
   - **Do not use your own details yet.**

2. **Type out the code yourself.**  
   - **No copy-pasting.**  
   - Don’t be un-serious and lazy.

3. **Take note of every element and step used.**

4. **Once done practicing, clear your code completely.**  
   - Now type it all out **again from the beginning**.  
   - This time:
     - Replace their details with **your own**.
     - Change the **colors**, **images**, and anything else you want to customize.

5. **Again, type the code yourself.**  
   - **No shortcuts or pasting.**  
   - Stay focused and thorough.

6. **After step 4 is complete:**
   - Copy your final code.
   - Paste it into **ChatGPT**, **Claude AI**, or **v0.dev**.
   - Use this prompt or similar:  
     > "Explain this code to me like I'm 5 years old."

7. **Make sure you understand the explanation.**  
   - Ask questions about anything you don’t get.  
   - Use your AI tool, or ask **me 😊**  
   - **Important:** Do **not** use AI to write your code—only to understand what you wrote by hand.
